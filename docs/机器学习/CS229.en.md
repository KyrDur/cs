Another course offered by Andrew Ng, but this is a postgraduate course, so it focuses more on mathematical theory, if you are not satisfied with off-the-shelf, and want to understand the essence of the algorithm, or aspire to engage in theoretical research on machine learning, you can take this course. All the lecture notes are provided on the course website, which are professional and theoretical, and require a solid mathematics skills.
