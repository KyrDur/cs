If you search on Zhihu for questions like “How to self-study operating system”, “Recommendations for operating system open courses”, “What are some computer courses that you wish you had learned earlier”, etc., HIT Li Zhijun’s operating system course will probably be in one of the high-voted answers. This is a well-known and popular Chinese computer course.

This course is good at guiding students from their perspective. For example, the course starts with “weakly asking, what is an operating system” to “lifting the lid of the operating system piano”, and introduces the concept of process from the intuitive management of CPU, and introduces memory management from “let’s first let the program enter memory”.

This course emphasizes the combination of theory and practice. Operating system is something that can be seen and touched. Teacher Li repeatedly emphasizes that experiments must be done. If you only watch videos and talk on paper, you will not learn operating system well. The course is based on the actual Linux 0.11 source code (total code size is about 20,000 lines) for explanation and experiments, with a total of eight small experiments and four large experiments.

Of course, this course also has some minor flaws. For example, Linux 0.11 is industrial code, not designed for teaching. Therefore, in the process of experimentation, there will be some unavoidable obscure and difficult codes, but they are not very helpful for understanding operating system.
