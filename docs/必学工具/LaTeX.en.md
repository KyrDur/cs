# LaTeX

## Why studying Latex?

If you have to write a paper, then jump to the next section because you have to learn Latex anyway.

LaTeX is a typesetting system based on TeX, developed by Turing Award winner Lamport, while Tex was originally developed by Knuth, both of whom are giants in the field of computer science. Of course, the developers' strengths are not the reason why we learn LaTeX. The biggest difference between LaTeX and commonly used word processors like Microsoft Word is that users only need to focus on the content of their writing, while the software automatically handles the typesetting. This allows ordinary people without any typesetting experience to produce professionally typeset papers or articles.  

Berkeley computer science professor Christos Papadimitriou once said a half-joking phrase:

> Every time I read a LaTeX document, I think, wow, this must be correct!

## How to study LaTeX

The recommended learning path is as follows:

- Setting up LaTeX environment can be a headache. If you encounter problems configuring it on your local machine, consider using [Overleaf], an online LaTeX editor. The website offers a variety of LaTeX templates and eliminates the difficulty of setting up the environment.
- Read the following 3 Tutorial: [Part-1], [Part-2], [Part-3].
- The best way to learn LaTeX is to write a paper, but starting with a math course and using LaTeX to write homework is also a good choice.

Other recommended introductory learning materials are as follows:

- A brief guide on installing LaTeX such as TEX Live Guide [[PDF](https://tug.org/texlive/)] can help you complete the installation and environment configuration process
- A (not so) short introduction to LaTeX2Îµ [[PDF](https://tobi.oetiker.ch/lshort/lshort.pdf)] [[GitHub](https://github.com/CTeX-org/lshort-zh-cn)] can help you get started with LaTeX quickly and accurately, it is recommended to read it thoroughly
