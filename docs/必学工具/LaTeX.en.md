## Why should we learn LaTeX

If you have to write a dissertation, please go straight to the next chapter, because you have to learn LaTeX even if you don't want to. 

LaTeX, which was developed by Lamport, a winner of the Turing Award, is a text layout system based on TeX. TeX was originally developed by Knuth. Both Knuth and Lamport are outstanding expert in computer science. Of cource, a strong developer is not the reason why we are learning LaTeX. The biggest difference between LaTeX and Microsoft word is that when you’re using LaTeX, you only have to focus on the writing itself, and the layout will automatically be done by LaTeX. This makes everyone, even someone without typesetting experience, can also write passages or essays with professional typesetting. 

Christos Papadimitriou, a professor at Berkeley once banteringly said: 

> Every time I read a LaTeX document, I think, wow, this must be correct! 

## How to learn LaTeX

Recommended learning roadmap: 

- Setting up the LaTeX environment is a big problem. If you met some trouble while setting it up, consider [Overleaf], an online LaTeX editor. There are a lot of templates there, and you don’t have to install LaTeX on your own PC. 
- Read the following tutorial: [Part-1], [Part-2], [Part-3]. 
- The best way to learn LaTeX is to write an essay, but it is also a good choice to use LaTeX to finish math homework as a try.

Here are some other recommended materials for getting started: 

- A short LaTeX introduction on [[GitHub](https://github.com/OsbertWang/install-latex-guide-zh-cn)] or TEX Live guide [[PDF]( https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc/texlive-en/texlive-en.pdf)] can help you with the installing and setting up process. 
- A (not so) short LaTeX2ε introduction (lshort-english) [[PDF](http://mirrors.ctan.org/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf)] will help you get started with LaTeX soon. 
- [LaTeX Talk](https://github.com/stone-zeng/latex-talk)
