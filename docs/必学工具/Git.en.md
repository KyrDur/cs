# Git

## Why Git

Git is a distributed version control system. Linux creator Linus Torvalds developed Git to maintain Linux versions, because he didn't like the centralized version control tool which was difficult and costly to use. 

The design of Git is very elegant, but beginners usually find it very difficult to use because it is difficult to understand its internal logic. Beginners who are not familiar with Git are easy to destroy the controlled versions because of mis-using its commands. 

But trust me, like Vim, Git is a powerful tool that you will exclaim 'it's worth it!' after you finally manage it.
