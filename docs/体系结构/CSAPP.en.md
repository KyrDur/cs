This course is one of CMU's most reputable courses, and is known for its extensive content and difficult projects. The course covers assembly language, computer architecture, operating systems, compilation and linking, parallelism, networking, etc. As an introductory course of computer system, it has both breadth and depth, and does require considerable perseverance and coding skills if you learn it on your own.

The textbook for this course, known as CSAPP, was written by Professor Bryant, Dean of the School of Computer Science at CMU. This is also my first computer textbook that I read carefully page by page, although it was a tough one, but I really gained a lot from it.

BYU has purchased the copyright for this course and opened the Introduction to Computer System course, but you can just access all of the CSAPP course resources and lab code on its official homepage (see link below for details).

This course is so famous that coders around the world are striving to learn it, resulting in the answers to its Project being almost readily available all over the Internet. But if you really want to develop your coding skills, it is highly suggested that do not copy any code from others.

After completing this course, your understanding of computer systems will definitely go up a notch.

 If you have trouble with Chapter 7 Linking, I recommend reading the book *Programmer's Self-Cultivation*, subtitled link. load and library. This book can complete our understanding of program linking, and I believe after reading this book you will have a deeper comprehension of program linking, ELF files, and dynamic libraries. It is highly recommended to be read as a supplementary material after reading CSAPP and having a certain understanding of computer systems.
