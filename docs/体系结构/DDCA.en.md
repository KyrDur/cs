In this course, Onur Mutlu, a great expert in the field of Computer Architecture, will teach you about digital design and computer architecture. The course is entirely from a computer design perspective, starting with transistors and logic gates and extending to microarchitecture, caches and virtual memory, and also covers many of the latest research advances in the field of computer architecture. There are 9 labs in the course, using the Basys 3 FPGA board and [Vivado](https://china.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vivado.html) to design the circuits, starting with combinational circuits and sequential circuits, and eventually deploying a complete CPU. Except for lab answers and current exam answers, all course materials are open source. After learning, you can master computer-related digital circuits, Verilog hardware description language, converting between MIPS and C, single-cycle MIPS, multi-cycle MIPS, pipelining, CPU design and performance analysis, cache, virtual memory and other important concepts.
