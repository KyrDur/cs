[Independent Activities Period](https://elo.mit.edu/iap/) (IAP) is a four-week period in January during which faculty and students are freed from the rigors of regularly scheduled classes for flexible teaching and learning and for independent study and research, and that's how this web development course was born.

Within a month, you will be equipped with the basic knowledge of how to design, build, beautify, interact, and other basic knowledge of a website from scratch. Basically covers most of the tech stack for the front-end and back-end of web development. If you just want to add it to your skill set for interest rather than learn web development systematically, then this course will be perfect for you.
