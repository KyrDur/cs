This course provides a comprehensive but concise introduction to the best practices of React front-end development and React Native mobile development, focusing on the latest versions of React and React Native. It is a valuable resource for tackling the complexities of front-end development.

The course also offers a good training ground. Be prepared for a significant workload throughout the semester. If you are unsure about how to write React code when doing homework, I recommend spending extra time carefully reading the relevant chapters on react.dev before diving in.

All course materials are open-source, but you will need to request an X-CS571-ID header from the instructor, Cole Nelson (ctnelson2@wisc.edu). The header will be necessary for API request. When sending an email, it is advisable to include a brief self-introduction.
