Excellent course, I benefited a lot from.

- The course focuses on basic and fundamental concepts, and teaches them in a way that is easy to understand: such as frame, stack memory, heap memory, etc.
- There are great exercises and programming to deepen and reinforce understanding of the hardest part of C to master, pointers.
- The course provides excellent practice in GDB, Valgrind, and the assignments will cover some basic Git exercises.
- The course instructor recommends Emacs for homework, so it's a good introduction for Emacs beginners. If you know how to use Vim, I suggest you use Evil. This way you don't lose the editing capabilities of Vim, and you get to experience the power of Emacs. Having both Emacs and Vim in your kit will increase your efficiency considerably. Emacs' org-mode, smooth integration of GDB, etc., will give you wings.
- It may require payment, but I think it's worth it.
- Coursera divided this large class into four smaller classes, but the transfer of the assignment files between the smaller classes did not go smoothly. It's kind of annoying. Fortunately, the later mini-lessons could grade the assignments from the previous ones, so I did the earlier assignments all over again. It is considered as consolidation and works well. 
- Although the course title is introductory, it has both breadth and depth.
