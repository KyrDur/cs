This course voted the the most popular public course by Harvard students for many years in a row. Professor Malan's classes are very passionate, and the scene of tearing up the yellow pages for talking about dichotomy method is very memorable (laugh). However, because of its introductory nature and the university-wide public election, the course content is relatively mild, but the quality of the coursework is very high and all free and open source, perfect for a beginner, or a big brother to relax.
