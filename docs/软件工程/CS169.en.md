# UCB CS169: software engineering

## Descriptions

- Offered by: UC Berkeley
- Prerequisites: None
- Programming Languages: Ruby/JavaScript
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Class Hour: 100 hours

This is Berkeley's software engineering course, unlike many traditional software engineering courses that emphasize various class diagrams, plan and document model , this course focuses on the recently trendy Agile Development model, which uses the cloud platform to provide software as a service. To achieve this, the instructors wrote [Software as a service](https://github.com/PKUFlyingPig/CS169-Software-Engineering/blob/master/saasbook.pdf), a textbook that explains the concept of SaaS in the Ruby/Rails, with plenty of programming assignments.

This course is available on [Edx](https://www.edx.org/), an online education platform sponsored by MIT and Harvard, where you can search for the course Agile SaaS Development and learn it yourself. The course content basically follows the order of the textbook and takes you step by step to build a software in an agile development way and deploy it on the cloud platform for free.
