*Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach* is a classic textbook in the field of computer networking. The two authors, Jim Kurose and Keith Ross, have carefully crafted a course website supporting the textbook, recorded online course videos, interactive online chapter tests and labs for packet analysis using WireShark. The only pity is that this course doesn't have hardcore programming assignments, and Stanford's [CS144](./CS144.en.md) makes up for that.
