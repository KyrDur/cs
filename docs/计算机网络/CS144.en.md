One of the lecturers of this course is Professor [Nick McKeown](http://yuba.stanford.edu/~nickm/index.html), a giant in the field of Networking. At the end of each chapter of MOOC, he will interview an executive in the industry or an expert in the academia, which can certainly broadens your horizons.

In the projects, you will use C++ to build the entire TCP/IP protocol step by step, implement IP router and ARP protocol, and finally use your own protocol stack to replace the protocol stack in Linux Kernel to communicate with your classmates, which is really amazing and exciting.
