In Berkeley's introductory course on artificial intelligence, the course notes are written in a very simple way, and there is basically no need to watch the course videos. The arrangement of the course content is basically in accordance with the chapter order of the classic artificial intelligence textbook *Artificial intelligence: A Modern Approach*, covering search pruning, constraint satisfaction problems, Markov decision process, reinforcement learning, Bayesian network, hidden Markov The husband model and basic machine learning and neural network related content.

The 2018 fall semester version opens gradescope for free, and everyone can complete written assignments online and get assessment results in real time. At the same time, the 6 projects of the course are also quality explosions, recreating the classic Packman (Pac-Man) mini-game, allowing you to use the AI knowledge you have learned to implement related algorithms, allowing your Pac-Man to shuttle freely in the maze , avoid ghosts, collect beans.
