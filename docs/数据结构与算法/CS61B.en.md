# CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms

## Descriptions

- Offered by: UC Berkeley
- Prerequisites: CS61A
- Programming languages: Java
- Difficulty: ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ
- Class Hour: 60 hours

It is the second course of UC Berkeley's CS61 series. It mainly focuses on the design of data structures and algorithms as well as gives students the opportunity to be exposed to thousands of lines of engineering code and gain a preliminary understanding of software engineering through Java.

I took the version for 2018 Spring. Josh Hug, the instructor, generously made the autograder open-source. You can use the invitation code published on the website at [gradescope](https://gradescope.com/) to join the course for free and easily test your own code.

All programming assignments in this course are done in Java. Students without Java basics don't have to worry. There will be detailed tutorials in the course. Starting from the configuration of IDEA, the core syntax and features of Java will be taught in detail, so you don't have to worry at all.

The quality of homework in this class is also unparalleled. The 14 labs will allow you to implement most of the data structures mentioned in the class by yourself, and the 10 homework will allow you to use data structures and algorithms to solve practical problems.
In addition, there are 3 projects that give you the opportunity to be exposed to thousands of lines of engineering code and hone your Java skills in practice.
