While the computational power of computers has been helping people to push boundaries of science, there is a natural barrier between the discrete nature of computers and this continuous world, and how to use discrete representations to estimate and approximate those mathematically continuous concepts is an important theme in numerical analysis.

This course will explore various numerical analysis methods in the areas of floating-point representation, equation solving, linear algebra, calculus, and differential equations, allowing you to understand (1) how to create estimates (2) how to estimate errors (3) how to implement estimates algorithmically in Julia's programming practice over and over again.

The designers of this course have also written a companion open source textbook (see link below) with plenty of Julia examples.
