Self learning CS has become a popular trend since the series of event such as Covid-19 pandemic and online learning.

Following the contributions and efforts from famous EU and US University to open source their quality CS course, self-learning CS is now highly accessible. With the consistent mindset and interest, the fruitful results of self-learning is comparable with learning from any CS programme offered by local university (Only applicable for domain speciality in CS. Graduate from a university gives a lot more than knowledges).

I am grateful for choosing self-learning CS during my high school. It made me fall in love in CS, expands my views and knowledges.

At the same time, there were obstacles and difficulties in executing self-learning. Numerous variaty of courses, scattered or missing information, inconsistent difficulties and time-consuming assignments......Despite the quality content, things may stay in bookmark untill the end.

At the forth year of my university, I wanted to share my experience and lessons gathered from self-learning. Journalling the path that made my life better and share with you guys. This ambition is now CS DIY,

My ultimate objective transform a CS new comer to a person with strong mathematic fundemental and programming skills in 2 to 3 years. Experiencing various projects with thousand lines of code, understand popular langauges (C/C++/Java/JS/Python/Go/Rust), a all-knowing CS guy with understanding on programming languge, algorithms, computer system, circuitary, networking, operating system, compilation, artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, reinforced learning, cryptograhic, game theory, data analysis, statistic, distributed computing, database system, graphical computing, web developement, cloud service and supercomputing
I believe with these great skills and knowledges, one can become more competitive despite joining a research or workfoce.
